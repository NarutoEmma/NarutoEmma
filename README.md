## Projects

### AI-Powered Pre-Consultation System
- Designed a system that gathers structured patient symptom data (frequency, severity, duration).
- Implemented a secure **code-based session flow** between doctors and patients.
- Built backend APIs using **Python & FastAPI**, with **MySQL** for data storage.
- Developed the mobile frontend using **React Native (Expo)** and TypeScript.
- Used **Git** for version control and collaboration.

### FocusFlow — AI-Powered Full-Stack Application
**Tech:** React Native (Expo), FastAPI / Node.js, Firebase Firestore, AI API, Render  
- Designed and developed a fully functional cross-platform application integrating cloud databases and AI services.
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints for secure data processing and user interaction.
- Applied AI-driven logic to extract structured information and intelligently handle incomplete or noisy user input.
- Deployed backend services to a cloud platform with robust input validation, error handling, and reliability in mind.

### Machine Learning Classification Project
- Built and evaluated multiple ML models for classification tasks.
- Implemented a **stacking classifier** to improve predictive performance.
- Focused on model comparison, reliability, and evaluation metrics.

### Unreal Engine Game Project
- Designed gameplay mechanics and environments using Unreal Engine.
- Implemented core game logic and interactive systems.
